Introduction to Simple Logic Gates
==================================

This chapter is about logic gates, each sub-chapter will go through a different
logic gate. Each gate has a visual representation through a symbol and comes
with a truth table, its logical operator and exercises.

Each gate is usually visually presented with one of two different ways, the IEC
(International Electrotechnical Commision) or the American version. We will use
the IEC version in this course.

A truth table is a table that lists inputs and the appropriate output for each
combination of inputs. Consider the following example:

"A lamp has two switches on opposite sides of a room, it is glows when either or
both light switches says ON."

In the truth table ON is represented with a 1 and OFF is represented with a 0.
The inputs, A and B, are the switches and the output, Y, is the lamp.

+---+---+---+
| A | B | Y |
+===+===+===+
| 0 | 0 | 0 |
+---+---+---+
| 0 | 1 | 1 |
+---+---+---+
| 1 | 0 | 1 |
+---+---+---+
| 1 | 1 | 1 |
+---+---+---+

In a later chapter, called "Boolean Algebra", we will use operators that
represents the effects of logic gates. We cover the operators through this
chapter to make you familiar with them.

Boolean Algebra
===============

Boolean algebra is the algebra of logical statements where variables are either
true or false. True and false is usually written as 1 and 2 respectively.

How you operators in programming languages sometimes varies, but in this course
we will stick to a specific set and trust that you later on can exchange the
symbols as required for future works. This is only to make it less confusing
while you are learning. In the table below the symbols and their meaning is
listed with an example.

+----------+---------+----------------+
| Operator | Symbols | Example        |
+==========+=========+================+
| AND      | *       | Y = A * B = AB |
+----------+---------+----------------+
| OR       | +       | Y = A + B      |
+----------+---------+----------------+
| NOT      | !       | 	Y = !A        |
+----------+---------+----------------+
| NAND     | !( * )  | Y = !(AB)      |
+----------+---------+----------------+
| NOR      | !( + )  | Y = !(A + B)   |
+----------+---------+----------------+
| XOR      | ⊕       | Y = A ⊕ B      |
+----------+---------+----------------+
| XNOR     | !( ⊕ )  | Y = !(A ⊕ B)   |

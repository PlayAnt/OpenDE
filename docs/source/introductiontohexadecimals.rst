Introduction to Hexadecimals
==================================

Lesson
------

Hexadecimals are useful in computer programming, especially in hardware near
languages. The hexadecimal system is another way to count, where as binary is
base-2 and the decimal system is base-10, hexadecimal is base_16.

To count in hexadecimals you start as usual: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and then follow
up with A B C D E F. A represents 10, B represents 11 ??. F represents 15.

Just like in the binary and decimal system one can combine digits to create
larger numbers where the digits increases in size as you go from right to left.

The first digit from right represents 16^0 and the next represents 16^1 and so
on. You might recognize the structure of the following table from the binary
chapter.

+--------+------+-----+----+---+
|Position| 4    |   3 |  2 | 1 |
+--------+------+-----+----+---+
|        |  16³ |  16²| 16¹|16⁰|
+--------+------+-----+----+---+
|        | 4096 | 256 | 16 | 1 |
+--------+------+-----+----+---+

The number B7 is thus equal to

11*16¹+7*16⁰ =

11*16+7*1 =

176 + 7 =

183

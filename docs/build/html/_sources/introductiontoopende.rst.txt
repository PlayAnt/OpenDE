The platform is divided into chapters each having one ore more sub-chapter where
most of them have some exercises to be performed. To pass a sub-chapter you need
to give the right answer to the exercises a number of times.

Answering correctly will give you a point, answering incorrectly takes a point
from you. You can never have less than zero points. Once you have the requested
number of points you pass the sub-chapter.

The last sub-chapter is usually an assemble of exercises from previous
sub-chapters and will serve as a repetition to make sure you remember all the
content.  To pass a chapter you need to pass all sub-chapters.
